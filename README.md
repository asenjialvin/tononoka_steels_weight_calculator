A web-based tool by **Tononoka Steels** for calculating theoretical weights in **steel slitting and shearing processes**.  

---

## üìñ Overview  
The **Tononoka Steel Processing Weight Calculator** enables our production teams and partners to perform **accurate, real-time weight calculations** during slitting and shearing operations. By digitizing processes that were once manual, the tool improves **planning accuracy, operational efficiency, and decision-making** across Tononoka facilities.

## üßÆ Formulas Used  

### Slitting  
```
Ribbon Weight (kg) = (Ribbon Width √ó Coil Weight) √∑ (Coil Width + 10)
Scrap Weight       = Parent Coil Weight ‚àí Œ£ Ribbon Weights
Scrap Width        = Parent Coil Width ‚àí Œ£ Ribbon Widths
```

### Shearing  
```
SWP (8ft sheet) = (Thickness/1000) √ó (Width/1000) √ó (2440/1000) √ó 7850
Partially Sheared Coil: Weight per sheet = (SWP √ó Sheet Length) √∑ 2440
Fully Sheared Coil: Meterage-based calculation
```
